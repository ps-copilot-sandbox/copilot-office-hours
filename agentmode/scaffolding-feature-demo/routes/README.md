# üõ£Ô∏è Routes Directory

This folder is intended for **Express route files** generated by GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

During the demo, Copilot will automatically create files (e.g., `productRoutes.js`) that define and export RESTful routes connected to services.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Do Not Add Files Manually

Please do **not manually add route files** here. This folder is part of a controlled demo, and all route scaffolding should happen through **Copilot Agent Mode**.

## Example Prompt

```plaintext
Scaffold a product route file that connects to createProduct and getProductById from the product service, and mount it under /api/products.
